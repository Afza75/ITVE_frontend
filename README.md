- CSS3
- JavaScript

**How to Run Locally**

**Pagination Approach**
Section-based pagination is implemented using dot navigation and smooth scrolling.
Each dot represents a section of the landing page. As the user scrolls, the active section is detected using JavaScript and the corresponding dot is highlighted.
Users can also click on any dot to directly navigate to a specific section.

**Key Design Decisions**
- Used a single consistent color theme for a professional look
- Designed full-screen sections for clear content separation
- Added clear call-to-action buttons
- Ensured full responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop
